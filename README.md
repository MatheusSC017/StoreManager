# E-Commerce Management API

This is a RESTful API designed to manage a company's stock and sales operations. It includes core 
tables for Users, Clients, Products, and Orders, allowing efficient tracking of inventory, customer data, 
and transaction history.

## Features

- Role-based access control (Admin, Regular)
- User, Client, Product, and Order management
- Automatic admin user creation on startup
- FastAPI interactive documentation
- PostgreSQL database support
- Dockerized environment for easy setup

---

## Start Application (Docker)

For reference I'm using the versions below to run the application

- Docker version 28.1.1
- Docker compose version 1.26.0

To run the application using Docker, run the command below:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

## Local Install

For this method make sure you have postgreSQL installed, create a virtual environment and use the commands below

1. Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Start the application:

```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Running Tests

Use pytest to run the test suite:

```
pytest
```

## API Documentation

- [Swagger UI](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

- [Redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc)

## Default Admin Account

On startup, the application automatically creates an admin user:

- Username: admin

- Password: admin

- Roles: Admin, Regular

This is necessary because user creation endpoints are restricted to users with Admin access.

## Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root of the project with the following contents:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/storedb
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_here
```

The SECRET_KEY and SENTRY_DSN must be generated by the user.

When running with Docker, the DATABASE_URL above is already correctly configured to connect to the PostgreSQL container.
